# Keras

# TensorFlow
* Building conv2d layers
     ->`tf.layers.conv2d` or `tf.nn.conv2d`
        no difference between them btw  
    -> wait, how can I set activation function with `tf.nn.conv2d`?  
    -> the shape of kernel_size and stride seems 4 dimensional data in `tf.nn.conv2d`
    -> `tf.nn.conv2d` has less args, so just use `tf.layers.conv2d`
        

* What is the `feature` of ReLU in VGG16 ?

# PyTorch
