## Setup for Kali

- Open VirtualBox and create new Virtual Environment
- Choose Linux, Debian 64bit
- Set RAM as 2048MB
- Skip Hard disk and Hard disk type
- Make sure choosing Dynamically allocated for Storage on physical hard disk
- Set 50 GB or more for File size
- Right-click -> Setting -> Storage -> Empty(Disk Icon) -> Choose Kali Linux IOS
- Double-click Virtual Environment and start Kali Linux

## Boot mode

- Live: You can boot from USB without installing, and after shut down everything will deleted.

- failsafe: like safe mode on windows

- forensic mode: for developers (we don't go for it anymore in this tutorial)

- Live USB Persistence: In this mode everything changed will be saved on the USB

- Live USB Encrypted Persistence: Great one. 



# Ep.08: Installing VirtualBox on Windows
Skip

# Ep.09: Kali Linux Installation
- Install
- BTW the default password for root is just root in Riverse; toor
- ext4: common partition for Linux
- We need root partition like 128GB, ext4, /
- SWAP is normally double size of RAM and use like RAM if RAM runs out in order to avoid crash
- Writing the change to the disk? -> **YES**
- Use a network mirror? -> NO
- Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record? -> YES
- 


# Ep.10
- Login to the Kali as root
- 99% of usage of Kali is some kind of attacks, so we usually login as root
- Verifying if we have the internet access by `$ ping google.com`
->設定無しで何故かネットに接続できてたのでそのまま先に進む。
