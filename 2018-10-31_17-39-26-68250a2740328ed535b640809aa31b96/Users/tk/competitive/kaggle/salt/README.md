All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.

## General
On the data description page, there is an explanation about how salt looks like in seismic images;
>There are several areas of the world where there are vast quantities of salt in the subsurface. One of the challenges of seismic imaging is to identify the part of subsurface which is salt. Salt has characteristics that makes it both simple and hard to identify. Salt density is usually 2.14 g/cc which is lower than most surrounding rocks. The seismic velocity of salt is 4.5 km/sec, which is usually faster than its surrounding rocks. This difference creates a sharp reflection at the salt-sediment interface. Usually salt is an amorphous rock without much internal structure. This means that there is typically not much reflectivity inside the salt, unless there are sediments trapped inside it. The unusually high seismic velocity of salt can create problems with seismic imaging.

- What is seismic image?

- Difference between velocity and speed? 
>Speed is how fast an object is moving. It is calculated by the displacement of space per a unit of time. Velocity is the rate at which an object changes position in a certain direction. It is calculated by the displacement of space per a unit of time in a certain direction. Velocity deals with direction, while speed does not.

- What is sediment?
Sediment is matter that settles to the bottom of a liquid; dregs.

> **Data**
The data is a set of images chosen at various locations chosen at random in the subsurface. **The images are 101 x 101 pixels and each pixel is classified as either salt or sediment.** In addition to the seismic images, the depth of the imaged location is provided for each image. **The goal of the competition is to segment regions that contain salt.**
