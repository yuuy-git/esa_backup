# Title
* [Efficient Interactive Annotation of Segmentation Datasets with Polygon-RNN++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09693.pdf)  
    
#Abstract
* produce polygonal annotations of objects interactively  using  humans-in-the-loop
* follow the idea of [Polygon-RNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05548.pdf)
  
FYI: Human-in-the-loop or HITL is defined as a model that requires human interaction.  
  
## important improvements
1. design a new CNN encoder architecture
1. show how to effectively train the model with Reinforcement Learning
1. significantly increase the output resolution using a Graph Neural
Network
FYI: Graph Neural Network is a neural network with graph computing (like Tensor Flow).
I found no articles about Graph Neural Networks but about [Graph Convolutional Networks](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/)
